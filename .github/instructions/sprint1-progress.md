# Sprint 1 Progress Tracker - CCIS Assessment Engine

**Sprint Period**: August 31 - September 6, 2025  
**Focus**: Foundation & Core Assessment Engine

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint 1 Goals (Based on GitHub Copilot Instructions)

### **Day 1**: Database & Core Types âœ… **COMPLETED**

### **Day 2**: Signal Collection Service (Starting Today)

### **Day 3**: Claude Integration & CCIS Calculation

### **Day 4**: Business Communication Tasks

### **Day 5**: Student Dashboard Components

### **Day 6**: Task Interface & Hint System

### **Day 7**: Integration Testing & Polish

---

## ðŸ“Š Current Implementation Status

### âœ… **COMPLETED** (Foundation Layer - 100%)

1. **Database Schema**: âœ… Prisma schema with Person, Student, SkillPassport tables
2. **Base Domain Classes**: âœ… Entity, AggregateRoot, ValueObject, DomainEvent
3. **Core Value Objects**: âœ… ID, Email, Phone, DateRange, Percentage
4. **Person Domain**: âœ… Complete domain with APIs published
5. **Event Infrastructure**: âœ… Publisher, Handler interfaces
6. **Exception Infrastructure**: âœ… Domain exception base classes

### ðŸŽ¯ **PRIORITY TODAY** (Day 2: Signal Collection Service)

According to the GitHub Copilot instructions, Day 2 should focus on **Signal Collection Service**. However, based on the current architecture, we need to first implement the **Assessment Domain** foundation before signal collection.

### ðŸš§ **NEXT IMPLEMENTATION QUEUE**

#### **Priority 1: Assessment Domain Foundation**

- [x] `src/modules/assessment/domain/value-objects/ccis-level.value-object.ts` âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] `src/modules/assessment/domain/value-objects/confidence-score.value-object.ts` âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] `src/modules/assessment/domain/value-objects/competency-type.value-object.ts` âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [ ] `src/modules/assessment/domain/value-objects/behavioral-signals.value-object.ts`#### **Priority 2: Assessment Entities**

- [ ] `src/modules/assessment/domain/entities/assessment-session.entity.ts` (Aggregate Root)
- [ ] `src/modules/assessment/domain/entities/task-interaction.entity.ts`
- [ ] `src/modules/assessment/domain/entities/competency-assessment.entity.ts`

#### **Priority 3: Assessment Domain Services**

- [ ] `src/modules/assessment/domain/services/ccis-calculation.service.ts`
- [ ] `src/modules/assessment/domain/services/signal-collection.service.ts`
- [ ] `src/modules/assessment/domain/services/claude-integration.service.ts`

## ðŸ”„ Implementation Strategy

### **File-by-File Approach** (As Requested)

1. Implement **ONE file at a time**
2. Stop and wait for confirmation
3. Update progress tracker
4. Move to next file

### **Starting Point Decision**:

Based on Sprint 1 instructions and current foundation, we should start with:

**`src/modules/assessment/domain/value-objects/ccis-level.value-object.ts`**

This is the core CCIS framework value object that drives everything else in the assessment system.

## ðŸ“‹ CCIS Framework Requirements (Critical Context)

### **CCIS Levels** (Must be implemented exactly):

- **Level 1 (0-25%)**: Dependent learner - needs step-by-step guidance
- **Level 2 (25-50%)**: Guided practitioner - seeks help strategically
- **Level 3 (50-85%)**: Self-directed performer - works independently
- **Level 4 (85-100%)**: Autonomous expert - can mentor others

### **Behavioral Signals** (Weighted Algorithm):

1. **Hint Request Frequency (35%)** - Primary independence indicator
2. **Error Recovery Speed (25%)** - Self-correction capability
3. **Transfer Success Rate (20%)** - Apply skills to novel problems
4. **Metacognitive Accuracy (10%)** - Self-assessment alignment
5. **Task Completion Efficiency (5%)** - Improvement over time
6. **Help-Seeking Quality (3%)** - Strategic vs generic questions
7. **Self-Assessment Alignment (2%)** - Prediction accuracy

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Action Required

**Recommendation**: Start implementing `src/modules/assessment/domain/value-objects/ccis-level.value-object.ts`

This value object will:

- Define the 4 CCIS levels with proper validation
- Include percentage ranges and descriptions
- Provide level comparison and progression logic
- Serve as foundation for all assessment calculations

**Ready to proceed?** âœ‹ Waiting for confirmation to implement the first file.
